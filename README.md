# EONET-Earth-Visualizer

Very small middle-school project I made using some NASA data to make an earth satellite viewer.

Using EONET and ESDIS data to make an earth viewer using HTML, CSS, JS.

We use the NASA EONET API (https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) to access data from the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)(https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs) that NASA provides.
